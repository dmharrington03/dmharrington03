Here's a bit about me and my work:

I'm interested in pursuing condensed matter and atomic/optical physics. I am looking to learn more about quantum computing, photonics, and ultracold atoms, as well as expand my general skillset and familiarity with physics. Outside of science, I love jazz and weightlifting. I'm also passionate about education, creating and expanding opportunities for youth and those with limited access to quality education.

C/C++ (SFML, Arduino)  
Python (numpy, matplotlib, Pandas, Flask, meep)  
Javascript (React, GatsbyJS, p5.js)  
SQL  


### Studying
Quantum Mechanics I  
Real Analysis I  
Mathematical Aspects of Data Analysis  


### Reading

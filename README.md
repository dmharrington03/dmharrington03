I'm Daniel, an undergraduate physics and math student at Tufts University. Here's a bit about me and my work:

I'm interested in quantum information science and physical systems for quantum simulation. I am looking to learn more about photonics, ultracold atoms, and machine learning, as well as expand my general skillset and familiarity with physics. Outside of science, I love jazz and weightlifting. I'm also passionate about education, creating and expanding opportunities for youth and those with limited access to quality education. 


### Technologies
Python (numpy, matplotlib, Pandas, Flask, meep)  
C/C++ (SFML, Arduino)  
Javascript (React, GatsbyJS, p5.js)
